An external database is a repository of structured information stored outside an application's primary storage. It enables data persistence, retrieval, and management, serving as a dedicated storage solution. Leveraging specialized database management systems, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB, facilitates efficient data organization, retrieval, and ensures scalability for applications with diverse data requirements.
